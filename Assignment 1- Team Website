      <p>Heya! My name is Devan and I'm a Gaming, Interactive, Media & Mobile major at Boise State University. I enjoy the visual/sound aspect of gaming and mainly have a knack for animation. I am currently gathering information for a "choice simulator" game idea, looking to make it from scratch or using Tyrano Builder. I enjoy playing games that have amazing visuals/music like Moonlighter, Pyre, Hotline Miami, and many more!</p>
